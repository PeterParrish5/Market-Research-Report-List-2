<p><strong>The Reflective Materials for Wearing Apparel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glass Beads</li><li>Microprismatic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Reflective materials used in wearing apparel can be divided into two main market types: glass beads and microprismatic. Glass beads are spherical particles that reflect light back to its source, making them suitable for low-light visibility. They are commonly used in high-visibility clothing like safety vests. Microprismatic materials, on the other hand, consist of tiny prisms that reflect light in multiple directions, making them more effective in a wider range of lighting conditions. These materials are often used in garments designed for outdoor activities or for enhancing visibility in various lighting conditions.</p></p>
