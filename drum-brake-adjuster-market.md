<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drum Brake Adjuster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Brake Adjuster</li><li>Automatic Brake Adjuster</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Drum brake adjusters are crucial components used to regulate the clearance between brake shoes and brake drums in vehicles. Manual brake adjusters are designed to be adjusted by hand, requiring physical intervention for adjustment. On the other hand, automatic brake adjusters are self-adjusting mechanisms that adjust the brake shoe clearance automatically as they wear down over time. These adjusters detect the wear and automatically adjust the clearance, reducing the need for manual intervention and ensuring optimal brake performance.</p></p>
