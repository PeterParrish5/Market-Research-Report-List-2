<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Watchdog Timers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Window Mode Watchdog Timer</li><li>Timeout Mode Watchdog Timer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive Watchdog Timers are devices used in automotive systems to monitor the proper functioning of electronic control units (ECUs). The Window Mode Watchdog Timer monitors the ECU for a specific time window, and if the ECU fails to communicate within that window, it assumes a fault and triggers a system reset. Timeout Mode Watchdog Timer sets a specific time limit, and if the ECU fails to respond within that timeframe, it considers it a fault and triggers a reset. Both types ensure the reliability and safety of automotive systems by detecting faulty ECUs and initiating necessary actions.</p></p>
