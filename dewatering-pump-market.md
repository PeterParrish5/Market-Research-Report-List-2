<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dewatering Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible Dewatering Pumps</li><li>Non-Submersible Dewatering Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dewatering pump market consists of two main types: submersible dewatering pumps and non-submersible dewatering pumps. Submersible dewatering pumps are designed to be fully immersed in water and work by pumping out water from underground or deep areas. These pumps are commonly used in construction sites, mines, and basements. On the other hand, non-submersible dewatering pumps are placed outside the water source and operate by drawing water into the pump through an inlet pipe. These pumps are typically used for smaller-scale dewatering tasks such as draining swimming pools or removing standing water from a floor.</p></p>
