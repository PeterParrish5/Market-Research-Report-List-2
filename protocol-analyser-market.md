<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Protocol Analyser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vector Network Analyser</li><li>Scalar Network Analyser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Protocol Analyser is a device used to capture, analyze, and interpret data traffic in computer networks. Vector Network Analyser (VNA) is a type of Protocol Analyser that measures the magnitude and phase of the signal in a network. It provides high accuracy and is commonly used in industries like telecommunications and aerospace. On the other hand, Scalar Network Analyser (SNA) measures only the magnitude of the signal, making it less precise but more cost-effective. SNAs find applications in fields like electronics and electrical engineering. Both VNAs and SNAs play a vital role in network troubleshooting and optimization.</p></p>
