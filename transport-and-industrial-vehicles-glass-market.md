<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transport and Industrial Vehicles Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated</li><li>Tempered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The transport and industrial vehicle glass market comprises two main types: laminated and tempered glass. Laminated glass is made by bonding multiple layers of glass together with an interlayer of plastic. This process enhances safety as the glass doesn't shatter upon impact but rather stays intact, reducing the risk of injuries. Tempered glass, on the other hand, is heat-treated to increase its strength and resistance to breaking. When it does break, it forms small, blunt pieces, minimizing the potential harm to passengers. Both types are commonly used in vehicles to ensure durability and safety.</p></p>
