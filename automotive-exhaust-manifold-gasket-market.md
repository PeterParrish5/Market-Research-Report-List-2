<p><strong>The Automotive Exhaust Manifold Gasket Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Engine</li><li>V Engine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive exhaust manifold gasket market caters to both straight engine and V engine markets. Straight engines have all cylinders in a single line, while V engines have cylinders arranged in a V shape. Both types of engines require an exhaust manifold gasket to seal the connection between the exhaust manifold and the engine block. This gasket prevents the leakage of exhaust gases and ensures proper engine performance. As a result, the demand for exhaust manifold gaskets remains steady in both straight engine and V engine markets.</p></p>
