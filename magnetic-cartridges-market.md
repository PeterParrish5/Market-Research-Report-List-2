<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Cartridges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Moving Magnet (MM)</li><li>Moving Coil (MC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The magnetic cartridges market includes two main types: Moving Magnet (MM) and Moving Coil (MC). Moving Magnet cartridges utilize a magnet attached to the cantilever that moves to generate the audio signal, while Moving Coil cartridges have a coil attached to the cantilever that moves in a magnetic field to produce the sound. MM cartridges tend to be less expensive and provide higher output, making them suitable for entry-level turntables. MC cartridges, on the other hand, offer superior sound quality and are preferred by audiophiles, despite being higher in cost.</p></p>
