<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Lubricating Improvers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acidic Lubricating Improver</li><li>Non-Acidic Lubricating Improver</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Diesel lubricating improvers refer to additives that enhance the performance and efficiency of diesel lubricants. Two types of diesel lubricating improvers commonly used are acidic and non-acidic lubricating improvers. Acidic lubricating improvers contain organic and inorganic acids, which react with the particles in the lubricant, creating a protective film that reduces friction and wear. Non-acidic lubricating improvers, on the other hand, do not contain any acids and work by modifying the molecular structure of the lubricant, improving its viscosity and reducing friction. Both types aim to improve the lubricating properties of diesel fuels.</p></p>
