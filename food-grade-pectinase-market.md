<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food Grade Pectinase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Protopectinase</li><li>Polygalacturonase</li><li>Pectin Lyase</li><li>Pectinesterase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The food grade pectinase market encompasses different types of enzymes used in food processing. Protopectinase is an enzyme that breaks down protopectin, a form of pectin found in fruits and vegetables. Polygalacturonase specifically targets polygalacturonic acid in pectin molecules and helps in its degradation. Pectin lyase cleaves the pectin backbone, while pectinesterase catalyzes the deesterification of pectin. Each of these enzymes has its own specific role in breaking down pectin, a complex polysaccharide, to improve texture and consistency in food products.</p></p>
