<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gliders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sailplane</li><li>Motor Glider</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>There are two main types of gliders in the market: sailplanes and motor gliders. Sailplanes are designed solely for gliding and rely on thermals, air currents, and gravity to stay in the air. They have a higher glide ratio, allowing for longer flights and better soaring performance. On the other hand, motor gliders are equipped with an engine, giving them the ability to take off and climb, while still being able to glide like sailplanes. This combination of both powered and gliding capabilities makes motor gliders versatile and suitable for various flight purposes.</p></p>
