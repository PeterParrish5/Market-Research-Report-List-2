<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheel Aligners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front end Alignment</li><li>Thrust-Angle Alignment</li><li>Four Wheel Alignment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wheel aligners market consists of three main types: front end alignment, thrust-angle alignment, and four-wheel alignment. Front end alignment refers to aligning only the front wheels of a vehicle, which is suitable for older models with solid rear axles. Thrust-angle alignment adjusts the front wheels and aligns them with the thrust line, which improves vehicle stability and reduces tire wear. Four-wheel alignment aligns all four wheels independently, providing accurate alignment for modern vehicles with complex suspension systems. These types cater to different vehicle models and help ensure proper alignment for improved performance and safety.</p></p>
