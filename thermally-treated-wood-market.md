<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermally Treated Wood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hardwoods</li><li>Softwoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermally treated wood market consists of two main types based on the source of wood: hardwoods and softwoods. Hardwoods are derived from broadleaf trees such as oak, maple, and cherry, which are known for their strength, durability, and high density. Softwoods, on the other hand, are obtained from coniferous trees like pine, cedar, and spruce, characterized by their relatively lower density and faster growth rates. These wood types undergo thermal treatment processes to enhance their properties, such as improved moisture resistance, increased stability, and reduced susceptibility to decay and pest attacks.</p></p>
