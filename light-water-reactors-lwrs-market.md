<p><strong>The Light Water Reactors (LWRs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs)</li><li>Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Light Water Reactors (LWRs) are the most common type of nuclear reactors used worldwide. There are two main types of LWRs: Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs). PWRs use highly pressurized water to transfer heat from the core to a secondary coolant loop, which then generates steam to power turbines. BWRs, on the other hand, allow the water in the core to boil and directly produce steam to drive turbines. Both types are considered safe and efficient methods of generating electricity from nuclear energy.</p></p>
