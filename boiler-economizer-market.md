<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Economizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steaming Economizer</li><li>Nonsteaming Economizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The boiler economizer market is divided into two types: steaming economizer and nonsteaming economizer. Steaming economizers are utilized in steam boilers, where they recover the waste heat from flue gases to preheat the feedwater, resulting in improved boiler efficiency. On the other hand, nonsteaming economizers are employed in hot water boilers and do not produce steam. They transfer waste heat from flue gases to the boiler feedwater or to the combustion air, leading to energy savings and reduced fuel consumption. Both types contribute to enhancing the overall efficiency of boilers.</p></p>
