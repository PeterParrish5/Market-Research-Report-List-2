<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire-proof Hydraulic Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HFA</li><li>HFB</li><li>HFC</li><li>HFD</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fire-proof hydraulic fluids are categorized into four types: HFA, HFB, HFC, and HFD. HFA fluids are water-in-oil emulsions, which contain a high water content and offer limited fire resistance. HFB fluids are water-in-oil emulsions with higher water content, providing improved fire resistance. HFC fluids consist of water glycol mixtures and offer even better fire resistance due to their higher water content. HFD fluids are synthetic fire-resistant fluids comprising phosphate esters, polyol esters, or other synthetic bases, making them the most fire-resistant option among the four types.</p></p>
