<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surge Absorbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low-power Absorbers</li><li>High-power Absorbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surge absorbers, also known as surge protectors or surge suppressors, are electrical devices used to divert excess voltage and protect electrical equipment from power surges. They come in two main types: low-power absorbers and high-power absorbers. </p><p>Low-power absorbers are designed for smaller electrical devices and appliances, such as computers, TVs, and smartphones. They provide protection against low-level surges commonly caused by fluctuations in the power grid or lightning strikes.</p><p>On the other hand, high-power absorbers are intended for larger systems and industrial applications, like factories or data centers. They are built to handle high-energy surges caused by factors such as lightning strikes, power line faults, or switching operations in the electrical grid.</p><p>Both low-power and high-power surge absorbers work by redirecting the excess voltage into the grounding system, ensuring that the protected equipment receives only a safe and stable voltage. This helps prevent damage, data loss, or malfunctioning of electrical devices during voltage spikes or transients, ultimately extending their lifespan.</p></p>
