<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compaction Paving Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Propelled</li><li>Tow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The compaction paving equipment market consists of two main types: self-propelled and towed equipment. Self-propelled machines are designed to move on their own and require minimal manual intervention. They are highly efficient and can handle large-scale projects. On the other hand, towed equipment needs to be pulled or towed by another vehicle. They are more suitable for small to medium-sized projects and require a separate power source. Both types serve the purpose of compacting asphalt or other materials during road construction, but their capabilities differ based on the scale of the project.</p></p>
