<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Manual Transmission Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OEM</li><li>Aftermarket</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>There are two main types of markets in the automated manual transmission (AMT) industry: OEM market and aftermarket market. The OEM market involves the sale of AMTs directly by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to automakers for integration into their vehicles during production. These AMTs are specifically designed and manufactured to meet the specifications of the automakers. On the other hand, the aftermarket market involves the sale of AMTs by third-party manufacturers or distributors to be installed in vehicles after they have left the factory. This allows vehicle owners to upgrade or replace their existing manual transmission with an automated one.</p></p>
