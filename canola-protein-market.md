<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Canola Protein Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrolyzed Rapeseed Protein</li><li>Canola Isolate Protein</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The canola protein market consists of two main types: hydrolyzed rapeseed protein and canola isolate protein. Hydrolyzed rapeseed protein undergoes a process in which the protein is broken down into smaller peptides, making it easier to digest and absorb. On the other hand, canola isolate protein is obtained by extracting and purifying the protein from canola seeds. Both types are widely used as plant-based protein ingredients in various food and beverage products due to their nutritional value and functional properties.</p></p>
