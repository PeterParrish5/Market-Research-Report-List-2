<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Tractor Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias-ply Tires</li><li>Radial-ply Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agriculture tractor tires are categorized into two main types: bias-ply tires and radial-ply tires. Bias-ply tires are constructed with multiple layers of fabric crisscrossed in an angle, providing a sturdy and strong tire suitable for heavy-duty applications. They are cost-effective and provide good traction but tend to wear out faster. On the other hand, radial-ply tires have steel belts running radially across the tire, giving it better flexibility, longer lifespan, and improved fuel efficiency. They offer a smoother ride, better traction, and reduced soil compaction.</p></p>
