<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rupture Disk Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Arch Type Rupture Disk</li><li>Inverse Arch Type Rupture Disk</li><li>Panel Type Rupture Disk</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The rupture disk market is categorized into three types: straight arch type, inverse arch type, and panel type. Straight arch type rupture disks have a convex shape that allows pressure to accumulate before breaking. Inverse arch type rupture disks, on the other hand, have a concave shape that requires less pressure to rupture. Panel type rupture disks consist of multiple layers that rupture in sequence to accommodate varying pressure levels. These different types offer distinct advantages and are used in various industries depending on specific pressure requirements and applications.</p></p>
