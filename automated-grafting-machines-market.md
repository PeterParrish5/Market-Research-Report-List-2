<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Grafting Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Automatic</li><li>Semi Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated grafting machines are becoming popular in the agricultural industry due to their efficiency and precision. There are two types of automated grafting machines: fully automatic and semi-automatic. Fully automatic machines are capable of performing the entire grafting process, from cutting the scions and rootstocks to joining them together, without human intervention. On the other hand, semi-automatic machines require some degree of human involvement, such as manually inserting the scions and rootstocks. Both types offer time and labor-saving benefits, but fully automatic machines provide a higher level of automation and require less human intervention.</p></p>
