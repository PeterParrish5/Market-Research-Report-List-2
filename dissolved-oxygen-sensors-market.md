<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dissolved Oxygen Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical (Luminescent) Type</li><li>Clark Electrochemical (Amperometric) Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dissolved Oxygen Sensors are divided into two main types: Optical (Luminescent) and Clark Electrochemical (Amperometric). </p><p>Optical sensors use a luminescent substance that emits a light signal when exposed to dissolved oxygen. This signal is then measured to determine the oxygen concentration. These sensors are accurate, stable, and have a fast response time.</p><p>On the other hand, Clark Electrochemical sensors rely on a chemical reaction between oxygen and a working electrode, producing a current that is proportional to the oxygen concentration. These sensors are reliable, widely used, and suitable for various applications, including water quality monitoring.</p></p>
