<p><strong>The Ice Slicer Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deicing</li><li>Anti-Icing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The ice slicer market primarily caters to the deicing and anti-icing needs. Deicing involves removing ice or snow from various surfaces, such as roads, aircraft, and walkways. Ice slicers are commonly used in this process to melt the ice and provide better traction. Anti-icing, on the other hand, refers to the prevention of ice formation by applying ice slicers proactively on surfaces. This helps to maintain the safety and efficiency of transportation systems during snowy or icy conditions.</p></p>
