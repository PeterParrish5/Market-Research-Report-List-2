<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Frequency Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Active</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radio frequency sensors are devices that use radio waves to detect and measure physical properties or signals. The market for these sensors can be categorized into two types: passive and active.</p><p>Passive RF sensors do not require an external power source and rely on the incoming radio waves to induce a current, enabling detection. These sensors are typically smaller, simpler, and more cost-effective.</p><p>Active RF sensors, on the other hand, require an external power source to generate their own radio waves. They transmit signals and analyze the response to measure characteristics such as distance, speed, or temperature. Active sensors typically offer enhanced accuracy and more advanced features but at a higher cost.</p></p>
