<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Parking Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forward</li><li>Rear View</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive parking radar is classified into two main types: forward and rear view systems. Forward parking radar uses sensors located at the front of the vehicle to detect obstacles, providing assistance to drivers when parking or maneuvering in tight spaces. Rear view parking radar, on the other hand, employs sensors at the rear of the vehicle to detect obstacles behind it, making it easier for drivers to park in reverse or avoid collisions while backing up. Both forward and rear view parking radar systems enhance safety and convenience for drivers in different parking scenarios.</p></p>
