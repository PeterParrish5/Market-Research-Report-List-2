<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fresh Air Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pipe Type</li><li>Non-Pipe Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fresh air systems are designed to provide clean and fresh air to buildings. There are two main types of systems: pipe type and non-pipe type. </p><p>Pipe type systems use a network of pipes to deliver fresh air from the outside to different areas of the building. They are typically used in large buildings with centralized ventilation systems, ensuring consistent airflow throughout the entire space.</p><p>Non-pipe type systems, on the other hand, do not rely on pipes. Instead, they use individual units placed in specific areas of the building to provide fresh air. This type is commonly used in smaller buildings or in areas where piping is not feasible.</p><p>Both market types aim to improve indoor air quality and provide a healthy and comfortable environment for occupants, but they differ in terms of the delivery method of fresh air.</p></p>
