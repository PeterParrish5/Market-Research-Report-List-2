<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed MRI Systems</li><li>Open MRI Systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used to visualize internal structures and organs of the body. There are two main types of MRI systems: Closed MRI Systems and Open MRI Systems. Closed MRI systems are traditional machines with a cylindrical tube-like structure, providing high-quality images but may cause claustrophobia. Open MRI systems, on the other hand, have a more open design with a wider bore, offering a less confined experience for patients, even though the image quality may be slightly lower. These different types cater to individual patient needs and comfort.</p></p>
